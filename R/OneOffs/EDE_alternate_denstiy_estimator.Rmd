output: pdf_document
---

This document derives multiple camera trap density estimators that allow for non-random sample designs in heterogeneous landscapes. The role of a camera trap density estimator is to estimate the density, $\lambda$. Total abundances are then calculated as a function of density, sampling frame ($A$), camera viewshed area ($V$), and sampling period ($T$), $$N = \frac{\lambda A}{V T}.$$

We estimate densities using the equilibrium solution of the EDE which assumes that animal densities are proportional to animal staying time, $$\frac{d_q}{\sum{d_q}} = \frac{\phi_q}{\sum{\phi_q}},$$ where $d_q$ is a density at location $q$ and $\phi_q$ is the staying time at location $q$.

We generalize the EDE by defining densities and staying time by habitat type rather than location, $d_h$ and $\phi_h$ for habitat type $h$. Then, we collect habitat-type specific staying times across the landscape with telemetry data. For example, with a GPS data set, we find that animals on average spend 50% of time in forested area, 35% on grassland, and 15% on road. With this information, we now know, for example, that road densities should be about 15% of total densities. We use this to calculate total abundances with camera traps as follows.

#### TDST Model

The TDST model calculates total density by estimating location-specific densities ($d_q$) and staying time ($\phi_q$) with camera trap data, $$\sum{d_q} = \frac{\sum{\phi_q}}{\phi_q} d_q.$$ Total abundances can then calculated with the formula above, $N = \frac{A \sum{d_q}}{V T}$. Note that the TDST model requires covariate information to inform location-specific staying time and density estimates.

#### PR model

The PR model estimates densities, $\lambda$, using only count data. Total abundances are then calculated using the formula above. The PR model may be used with and without covariate information, although random sampled designs are required for non-biased estimates when covariates are not used.

#### Habitat PR Model

We combine the theory behind the TDST model with density estimates obtained with the non-covariate PR model to explicitly calculate habitat-specific abundances using relative staying time estimates obtained from telemetry data. Specifically, in order to calculate habitat-specific abundances, we must first scale the sampling period by the proportion of time that animals spend in the habitat type, $T_h = T \frac{\phi_h}{\sum{\phi_h}}$, and the proportion of cameras placed in the habitat type, $\frac{C_h}{\sum{C_h}}$. Then, by using the PR model to estimate densities for each habitat type ($\lambda_h$) and restricting the sampling to the area that contains the habitat type, $A_h$, we calculate habitat-specific abundances using the formula $$N_h = \frac{\lambda_h A_h}{V T_h} \frac{C_h}{\sum{C_h}}.$$ The sum over all habitat-specific abundances results in total abundance, $N = \sum{N_h}$.

The habitat PR model can also be explicitly defined for single-habitat sample designs (i.e., cameras placed exclusively on one habitat type). Specifically, the proportion of cameras placed in the habitat of choice is now 1 while all other habits have 0 cameras, setting all habitat-specific abundances without cameras to zero. Then, total abundance given cameras placed only in habitat $h$ is $$N = \frac{\lambda_h A_h}{V T_h},$$ where habitat-specific density, $\lambda_h$, is calculated as above.

#### Results

To test these models, we ran simulations where animals move with three different speeds depending on habitat type (slow, medium, fast), and place cameras under three sample designs; randomly, non-randomly (80% in slow habitat, 10% each in medium and fast habitats), and single-habitat (100% in slow habitat). We then estimated total abundances with the TDST model without priors, TDST model with stay-time priors defined by telemetry data but omitting camera stay time data (TDST no-data), PR model with and without covariates, and habitat PR models.

The following boxplots represent summaries of model runs over 1000 iterations. The habitat PR model seems off since it is overestimating abundances in the random sample design but is accurate in th 80% sample design. When placing all cameras in one habitat type, none of the models can accurately estimate abundances but the PR habitat model and TDST no data are the most accurate.

<!-- Habitat-specific abundances may be calculated by multiplying habitat-specific densities by the area of the habitat, $$N_h = \frac{\lambda_h A}{V T} \frac{A_h}{\sum{A_h}} = \frac{\lambda_h A_h}{V T}.$$ This formula assumes that cameras are placed in each habitat type, although they do not need to be placed proportional to the habitat type availability, i.e., random sampling. Summing over all habitat-type abundances gives total abundance. -->

<!-- We extend the TDST model by scaling the densities by the proportion of time spent in each habitat type, providing separate total abundance estimates for each habitat type, $$N = \frac{\lambda_h \sum{\phi_h}}{\phi_h} \frac{A_h}{V T} = \frac{\lambda_h A_h}{V T_h},$$ where $T_h = T \frac{\phi_h}{\sum{\phi_h}}$ is the habitat-specific sampling period. The issue with this method is that the errors change for each estimate depending on how much data are collected in each habitat type. To account for this, we can scale the full estimates by the proportion of cameras deployed in each habitat type to get camera-adjusted habitat abundances, $$N_h = \frac{\lambda_h \sum{\phi_h}}{\phi_h} \frac{A_h}{V T} \frac{C_h}{\sum{C_h}} = \frac{\lambda_h A_h}{V  T_h} \frac{C_h}{\sum{C_h}}.$$ Summing over this value gives total abundance. This last formula effectively estimates densities at each habitat type by accounting for the proportion of time spent in each habitat type and the proportion of cameras placed in each habitat type. -->

<!-- NOTE: These equations assume that the mean camera counts ($\lambda$) is calculated with all of the cameras in the data. A simpler way to write the formula is to assume that the mean estimates only use cameras in the habitat type. Then we can stop at the second equation. -->

<!-- ##### Cameras Placed in One Habitat Type (Full-Bias Sample Design) -->

<!-- If we place all cameras on one habitat type, e.g., roads, then we can estimate total densities as $$\sum{d_h} = \frac{d_h \sum{\phi_h}}{\phi_h}.$$ $\phi_h$ for all $h$ may be estimated with GPS data or camera trap data, then all that is left to estimate is road density, $d_1$. We can do this with the same likelihood methods for estimating densities as the Poisson regression but with the sampling frame and sampling period adjusted to the size of the habitat type and the proportional time spent in the habitat type. For example, if the total sampling frame is 900 km$^2$ and the road habitat type is 10% of the total area, then the sampling frame for road density is $A_1 = 90 km^2$. Similarly, if the total sampling period is 1000 hours, then the sampling period for road density is adjusted to 15% of the total sampling period, or $T_1 = 150$. Combining all of this together, we can calculate total abundance with $$N = \frac{\lambda_1 \sum{\phi_1}}{\phi_1} \frac{A_1}{V T} = \frac{\lambda_1 A_1}{V T_1},$$ where $\lambda_1$ is the road density, and $V$ is the camera viewshed area NOTE:CHECK THIS MATH. NOT SURE IF DENSITY IS PROPERLY DEFINED -->

<!-- ##### Cameras Non-randomly (Partial-Bias Sample Design) -->

<!-- If cameras are placed non-randomly but encounters are recorded in every habitat type, the above formula may be generalized to account to for the partial-bias camera placement. Camera-adjusted, habitat-specific abundances (abundances scale with camera proportions in habitat) are defined as $$N_h = \frac{\lambda_h \sum{\phi_h}}{\phi_h} \frac{A_h}{V T} \frac{C_h}{\sum{C_h}} = \frac{\lambda_h A_h}{V  T_h} \frac{C_h}{\sum{C_h}}$$ where $C_h$ is the number of cameras located in habitat $h$. Total abundance is calculated as the sum of all habitat type abundances, $\sum{N_h}$. CHECK -->

<!-- NOTE: Understand the difference between the full-bias design and partial-bias and why deconstructing the full design into weighted-camera abundances provides a better estimate. There is probably a better way to describe it other than weighted-camera abundance. -->

<!-- ##### Estimating relative staying times -->

<!-- To use the formulas above, staying time must be estimated and can be done so with either gps collar data or camera traps. If camera traps are used, then cameras must be placed in every habitat type, which is not a requirement if staying time data are collected from collars. -->

<!-- Test these methods (staying time estimated with cameras vs gps)! -->

<!-- -   Compare these two with partial-bias sample designs. How much more accurate are the GPS models? -->

<!-- -   Compare the GPS-collected data with random, partial-bias, and full-bias sample designs. Do we get better precision if we place all cameras on one habitat type? -->

#### NOTES

<!-- -   When subbing the TDST stay time data for collar data summaries (i.e., only use count data without any camera trap stay time data), the prior sds on kappa must be small to let the model fit to the priors. Also, the priors do not need to be exactly the staying time but the proportion of time spent in each habitat type -->

-   I can't figure out how to translate cell-size staying time to camera viewshed-size staying time. Multiplying by camera area over cell area doesn't seem to work (oddly enough, this scaling works for counts...). Again, this doesn't pose a problem for the TDST when stay time data are omitted, but is useless when staying time data (from cameras) are used.

<!-- -   The habitat PR model works just as well as the TDST prior-no data model (I think they are pretty much equivalent). When fitting the habitat PR model with 0 cameras placed in a habitat type, the habitat-specific camera count must be set to 0, otherwise the uninformed priors on the 0-camera habitat types will run wild. -->

-   We need to think about how to estimate sds from habitat-specific staying time collected from collars. Currently, the habitat PR model does not use any SD and the TDST with priors-no data has a forced small prior variance.
