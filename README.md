# camera-trap-density-estimators
A collection of code to run different camera trap density estimators for non-identifiable individuals. Models include the equilibrium solution of the diffusion equation (EEDE), random encounter and staying time (REST) model, time to event (TTE) model, space to event (STE) model, and mean count (MCT) model.
